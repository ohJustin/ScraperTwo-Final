3. Run the command from the professor's PDF. E.G ("To Run Program -> *** python .\main.py *URL* ***")

**NEW PROJECT README**
First...
run 'pip install beautifulsoup4' and 'pip install requests'

Lastly...
You can run my program by typing 'python .\main.py file.txt'.
file.txt is the file you are reading from which is from webscraper-1.

The instructions stated to extract comments from the previous project's file, I am not sure if the intention was to extract from ANY file. But, the modification can be easily made, in fact I have a seperate program ready to submit if this was not the intention. Please email me if so, jusburn@siue.edu. 

P.S - The error stated during the console run should be ignored, it does not hinder my program from extracting ALL comments.
